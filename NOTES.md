# Tap Room #

## Notes ##

A big component working on the tap-room is knowing the differences between react and angular and how to apply what I need on-screen. With angular, I'm still in the early learning phases, so I may need to return to this doc and update it in the future.

### Installation ###

`REACT` and `Angular` are both equal in installation/setup. They both require hefty amount of installations before use

### Work Flow ###


### Routing ###

`REACT` is the clear winner here thanks to react-router. A simple install: `npm install react-router-dom@4.0.0 --save` importing the HashRouter, Switch, Route and Link `import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';` `import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';` `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';` and the rest is smooth sailing. I just need to link to my destination ( similar to an anchor ) and create routers for them.
